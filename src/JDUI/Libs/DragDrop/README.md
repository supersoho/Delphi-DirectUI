4. Known problems:
-------------------------------------------
* When the demo applications are compiled with Delphi 7, some of them
  will probably emit a lot of "Unsafe type", "Unsafe code" etc. warnings.
  This doesn't mean that there's anything wrong with the demos. It just
  means that Borland, at that time, wanted you to know that they were
  moving to .NET and would like you to do the same (so you can buy the
  next version of Delphi).
  You can turn the warnings of in the project options.

* Delphi's and C++Builder's HWND and THandle types are not compatible.
  For this reason it might be nescessary to cast C++Builder's HWND values to
  Delphi's THandle type when a HWND is passed to a function. E.g.:

    if (DragDetectPlus(reinterpret_cast<THandle>(Handle), Point(X, Y))) {
      ...
    }

* Virtual File Stream formats can only be pasted from the clipboard with live
  data (i.e. FlushClipboard/OleFlushClipboard hasn't been called on the data
  source). This problem affects TFileContentsStreamOnDemandClipboardFormat and
  the VirtualFileStream demo.
  This is believed to be a bug in the Windows clipboard and a work around hasn't
  been found yet.

* When TDropFileTarget.GetDataOnEnter is set to True, the component doesn't work
  with WinZip.
  Although the file names are received correctly by TDropFileTarget, WinZip
  doesn't extract the files and the files thus can't be copied/moved.
  This is caused by a quirk in WinZip; Apparently WinZip doesn't like
  IDataObject.GetData to be called before IDropTarget.Drop is called.

BCB 6 Installation instructions for the Registered Source Code version of VCLZip:

If you have installed VCLZip previously, including the evaluation version, you can if you wish, install this new version to the same directory.  The installation will overwrite files so you may wish to make a backup of the current files first. In this case, you will only need to proceed through step 6 of the instructions below.

================

1) Select File|Open from the menu. 

2) Browse to the directory that you installed the VCLZip files to

3) In the "Files of Type" drop down combo box select "C++Builder file (*.cpp,*.bpg,*.bpr,*.bpk)"

4) In the directory list box select VCLZipBCB6_4.bpk

5) Click on the Open button

6) A window will appear.  Press the Compile button.  This will create or recompile the package.

7) Press the Install button if it is enabled.  This will install VCLZip, VCLUnZip, and TSFXConfig to the VCLZip tab of the component palette.

8) Close the window.

9) Be sure, for any project that uses VCLZip or VCLUnZip, the path where you installed the VCLZip files is included in your "Project | Options" Directory/Conditionals Tab's Include Path textbox.

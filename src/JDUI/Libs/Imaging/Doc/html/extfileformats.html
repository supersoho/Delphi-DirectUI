    <span class="title">File Format Extensions</span>
    <p class="para">These extensions allow Imaging to load and save images from/to
      files in various formats.
      File formats included in Imaging core (that is in
      <code class="keyword">Source</code> directory) must satisfy these requirements:
      both loading and saving support, native crossplatform
      Object Pascal implementation, support as many data formats as possible,
      be stream safe (you have multiple images in one stream and you load them
      one by one without exactly knowing where they start - after loading one
      stream position must be precisely at the beginning of another - some
      file formats (e.g. Daggerfall images) need to know exact file size during loading so
      they are inherently unsafe).
      File format loaders/savers that do not meet these requirements are
      located in Extras package (<code class="keyword">Extras\Extensions</code> directory).
    </p>
    <p class="para">Some complex file formats make compiled binaries significantly larger.
      Most notably <b>TIFF</b> (around 400 KiB),
      <b>JPEG</b> (around 100 KiB), <b>JPEG2000</b> (around 150 KiB), and <b>PNG</b>
      (around 50 KiB). Some formats use others internally - <b>MNG</b> and <b>JNG</b> use
      PNG and JPEG. If you know you won't be needing some of those formats
      and you don't want large binaries you can disable them at compile stage.
      
      This is done by uncommenting <code class="codeinline">DONT_LINK_*</code> (where * is file format
      identifier) symbols in 
      <code class="codeinline">ImagingOptions.inc</code> include file
      located in <code class="keyword">Source</code> directory.
      All core file formats have corresponding symbols here and all
      are enabled by default in this include file.
      
      There is also <code class="codeinline">DONT_LINK_EXTRAS</code> symbol that controls
      automatic linking with file formats declared in Extras package
      (individual <code class="codeinline">DONT_LINK_*</code> symbols for these file format can be turned 
      on/off in <span class="codeinline"><span class="link"><a href="../RefDoc/ImagingExtras_pas.html">ImagingExtras.pas</a></span></span>
      unit located in <code class="keyword">Extras\Extensions</code> directory).
    </p>
    <div class="warning">Warning:
    <span class="ntwpara">In Imaging 0.26.2 file format linking symbols were changed 
      from <code class="codeinline">LINK_*</code> to <code class="codeinline">DONT_LINK_*</code>.
      So if you used these symbols somewhere in you projects 
      please check your code if it still works as intended 
      after 0.26.2 installation.
      <br/>
      Why did it change?<br/>    
      Since all formats are enabled by default in Imaging releases, 
      if you wanted to disable one format you had to manually edit 
      <code class="codeinline">ImagingOptions.inc</code> and comment out appropriate 
      <code class="codeinline">$DEFINE</code> statement.
      So there was a problem when you had more projects using the same 
      Imaging installation and each wanting to use different subset of file formats.
      With new symbols you don't have to edit the include file at all, 
      just add <code class="codeinline">DONT_LINK_*</code> to "Conditional defines" (or its Lazarus equivalent)
      in compiler options of each project.

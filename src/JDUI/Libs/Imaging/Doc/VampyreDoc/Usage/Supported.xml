    <title>Supported Compilers and Platforms</title>
    <par>
      Main development language is <b>Object Pascal</b> and two
      main supported compilers are <b>Borland/CodeGear/Embarcadero Delphi</b> and <b>Free Pascal</b>.
      <b>Kylix</b> worked too but latest versions were not tested 
      (IDE won't work well in current Linux distros). 
      <b>C++ Builder</b> crashes on internal error.
      Other Pascal compilers like GPC or TMT were not tested (probably won't work).
      Supported platforms are now <b>Windows</b>, <b>Linux</b>, <b>Mac OS X</b> (Intel), <b>FreeBSD</b>
      (some other Unix systems most probably too).
      Imaging was tested on 32bit <b>x86</b>
      and 64bit <b>AMD64</b> (Linux64 and Win64 using Free Pascal)
      CPU architectures.
      It could work on some big endian machines too (except some file format loaders
      that assume little endian) but I can't test it on any.

      Following table contains information about which compilers have
      been tested and whether Imaging was successfully compiled by them.

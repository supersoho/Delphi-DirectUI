      X Pixmap is an ASCII-text-based image format used by the X Window System.
      It was created in 1989 at the INRIA, France, and was later enhanced.
      It is intended primarily for creating icon pixmaps,
      and supports transparent color.
      It has a simple structure.
      It can be created and manipulated using any text editor
      and can be included in a C language file.

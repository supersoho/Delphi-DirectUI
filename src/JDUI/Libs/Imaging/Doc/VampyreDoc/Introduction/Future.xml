    <title>Vampyre Imaging Library Future</title>

    <par>
      In the long term I'm planning to redesign and rewrite major parts
      (practically create new library - no compatibility with current version)
      of library in future to make it more compact and easier to use and extend.
    </par>
    
    <par>
      Current 0.2x branch is still be updated from time to time
      by minor release (like 0.24.2) or even larger release with more
      new functionality (like 0.26.0).
      Eventually, this branch will be made into version 1.0 (maybe just 
      after current 0.26.4 release).   
    </par>
    
    <par>
      Since I don't have that much free time these days I cannot say when
      new library will be ready. Although I have some desings done, it's
      still far from usable code.
      Working in progress version of Imaging 2.0 will be 1.9x branch in SVN 
      when there is some code to show.
    </par>    
    
    <par>Here is a list of some of the features I want to include in future
      Imaging releases:</par>
    <bulletlist>
      <li>new library core</li>
      <li>native Pascal TIFF support</li>
      <li>register your own data formats</li>
      <li>native Pascal JPEG2000 support</li>
      <li>more texture related functions</li>
      <li>extend canvas class (more effects, drawing of various primitives)</li>
      <li>own file format?</li>
      <li>more supported platforms (big endian?)</li>
    </bulletlist>

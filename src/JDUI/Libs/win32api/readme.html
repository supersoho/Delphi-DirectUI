  <h3>18 februari 2002</h3>
  <p><b>Lan Manager header files (lm*.h).</b>
  <p>Reason for this addition is twofold:<br>
  <ol>
    <li>The LM.pas interface unit included in this package was getting out of 
        synch with the original from Petr and errors were creeping in. Conversion 
        from scratch was imo the only way to remove all these errors.
    <li>The original LM interface units were done by Petr and his copyright. This
        somewhat limits me in my freedom to do as I want with those units.
  </ol>
  <p>
  Petr's original LM interface unit is still included (JwaLM.pas) for those that
  are already using it. New development should use either Petr's original units
  (available from http://www.delphi-jedi.org) or the new units included in this
  release (the individual JwaLmXYZ.pas units, not JwaLM.pas). Existing applications
  should continue to use the JwaLM.pas unit as the new units are different in many
  aspects (e.g. in the conversion of parameters, types and so forth).
  Eventually JwaLM.pas from Petr will be removed...
  </p>
  <p>
  <b>Up to date with November 2002 Platform SDK</b>
  <p>
  The units are now up to date with the November 2002 release of the Platform SDK.
  This means that the included units are up to date with their equivalent header
  files in the PSDK, not that all header files are converted - obviously..
  The only files that are not yet up to date are:<br>
  <ul>
    <li>NtDsApi.pas</li>
    <li>NtSecPkg.pas</li>	
	<li>WinCrypt.pas</li>
  </ul>
  Hopefully I'll be able to attend to these soon.
  </p>

  <h3>8 januari 2002</h3>
  <p>
  The most significant change in this release is the addition of dynamic linking
  support for all units. By default dynamic linking is turned off, to turn on
  dynamic linking remove the dot in the line:<br>

  <pre class=syntax>
  {.$DEFINE DYNAMIC_LINK}
  </pre>

  <p>
  inside WinDefines.inc. In this release this will turn on dynamic linking for all
  interface units, in a future release I might add support to contorl this on a
  unit-by-unit basis. Dynamic linking is supported by using a small assembler stub
  that loads the DLL on demand only when the routine is actually used. There is no
  need to call any special initialization routine, all happens automatically.
  Thanks goes out to the guys in borland.public.delphi.basm for their help in
  implementing this.

  <p>
  Please note that currently there is no way to find out upfront whether or not a
  required library is present on the system other than explicitly testing this
  yourself using LoadLibrary(), a future release might add support for this. In
  case the required library is not present on the system, an exception is raised.
  The exception is either EJwaLoadLibraryError or EJwaGetProcAddressError (both
  defined in JwaWinType and descended from EJwaError) if LoadLibrary() or
  GetProcAddress() fails respectively. Therefor, you'll need to protect your API
  calls using a try...except block like this:<br>

  <pre class=syntax>
  var
    H: HANDLE;
  begin
    try
      H := CreateFile(...);
      if H <> INVALID_HANDLE_VALUE then
      begin
        ...
        CloseHandle(H);
      end;
    except
      on EJwaError do
      begin
        // Either CreateFile or CloseHandle could not be found, handle that
        // situation somehow.
      end;
    end;
  end;
  </pre>

  <h2>Known issues</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>All functions with the cdecl calling convention do not yet support dynamic 
        linking. This mostly involves JwaWinBer and JwaWinLdap but there exist a few
        other instances.
    <li>There are still plenty of TODO markers :-(
    <li>The JwaAdsTLB unit has a few errors. This is a type library import and the
        errors are a result of bugs in the Delphi type library importer, not mine.
        Thanks to Chris Burr for pointing this out, sorry Chris but I haven't had
        time to fix it yet.
  </ul>

  <h2>Installation</h2>

  The Win32 interface units do not need explicit installation but you do need to
  make sure that Delphi can find them. There are two ways to accomplish this,
  using Project Options or Environment Options. First you need to extract the zip
  into a directory of your liking, we'll refer to this directory as $(WIN32API).
  Now follow either of the steps outlined in the next two sections.

  <h4>Using Project Options</h4>

  From the IDE menu select "Project > Options" and switch to the
  "Directories/Conditionals" page in the dialog that appears. Find the edit box
  labelled "Search Path", type in the $(WIN32API) path and select OK. Alternatively
  you can use the ellipsis button to navigate to the directory in question. You
  will need to repeat this for every new project you start that uses the Win32 API
  interface units.

  <h4>Using Environment Options</h4>

  From the IDE menu select "Tools > Environment Options" and switch to the "Library"
  page in the dialog that appears. Find the edit box labelled "Library Path", it
  should contain something along the lines of "$(DELPHI)\Lib;$(DELPHI)\Bin;$(DELPHI)\Imports;$(DELPHI)\Projects\Bpl".
  Change this to include the $(WIN32API) directory. For example, assuming you've
  unzipped the Win32Api.zip file to "c:\win32api":<br>
  "$(DELPHI)\Lib;$(DELPHI)\Bin;$(DELPHI)\Imports;$(DELPHI)\Projects\Bpl;c:\win32api".
  Don't forget to seperate using a semicolon. You don't have to manually edit this
  string, you can press the ellipsis button to navigate to the $(WIN32API) directory
  and add it automatically. After pressing OK Delphi will be able to find the units
  for every new project without the need to specify the directory again.

  <p>
  If you performed the steps above you can start using the units in your application
  by including the appropriate ones in your uses clause. I personally prefer to
  use Project Options instead of Environment Options to avoid problems. One known
  problem is that when you use the Enironment Options method, you might get compiler
  errors when trying to build the JEDI Code Library.

  <h2>Using the units</h2>

  When you use these interface units keep in mind that they duplicate a lot of
  what's in the interface units that ship with Delphi, such as Windows.pas. These
  units can co-exist but you need to make sure that you do not mix the usage of them
  too much. For example, either use Windows.pas or the equivalents in this library
  but not both, otherwise you might run into incompatibilities between them resulting
  in compile errors. The easiest way is to not include both in the uses clause of
  your own units. If this is impossible for some reason you're best of using explicit
  unit qualification when using anything. For example, instead of using "CreateProcess"
  use either "Windows.CreateProcess" or "JwaWinBase.CreateProcess". If you do not use
  unit qualification you end up using the one from the unit last mentioned in the
  uses clause.

  <p>
  The most common error you're likely to encounter is:
  "Incompatible types: 'System.WideChar' and 'JwaWinType'.WideChar" where WideChar
  is only an example. This is due to the fact that the RTL (e.g. System.pas or
  Windows.pas) defines the type WideChar differently from WinType.pas. To solve
  this simply change the declaration in JwaWinType.pas to become an alias for the
  type in System.pas (or Windows.pas). For example
  Before:
  <pre class=syntax>
  <b>type</b>
    DWORD = Longword;
  </pre>
  After:
  <pre class=syntax>
  <b>type</b>
    DWORD = Windows.DWORD;
  </pre>
  If you look inside JwaWinType.pas you see that I've already done this for the most
  common types (using conditional compilation) like this
  <pre class=syntax>
  <b>type</b>
    DWORD = {$IFDEF USE_DELPHI_TYPES}Windows.DWORD{$ELSE}Longword{$ENDIF};
  </pre>
  therefore it's unlikely you'll run into this problem. However, if you do please
  notify me so I can update the interface units.

  <p>
  Please note that these units heavily use conditional compilation. You can
  globally change some settings, and thereby determine how they get compiled,
  through the WinDefines.inc include file. An example of this would be to specify
  an unicode build. There are a few more directives which cannot be set globally
  (yet), look through the unit itself to find them. Full documentation for all
  directives will be provided in a later release.

  <p>
  Also note that all LanManager units (LM*.pas) were combined into a single
  unit LM.pas for convenience. The same applies to the Ads*.pas units which
  were combined into ActiveDS.pas and all Rpc*.pas files which were combined
  into Rpc.pas. Furthermore, the LanManager translation was done by Petr Vones
  and is included with his permission. The WinLDAP unit was created by Luk Vermeulen.</p>

  <h2>Copyright</h2>

  These units are distributed under the terms of of the MPL, or optionally the
  terms of the LGPL. What this means is that they are completely free and can
  be used in all development, even commercial applications. I have a few requests

        you understand your rights and obligations.
    <li>If neither the MPL and LGPL fit your needs you I can grant you a different
        license. <a href="mailto:brakelm@chello.nl?subject=Win32Api Licensing">
        Contact me</a> for more information. Depending on the details, this will
        cost you something though (dunno what exactly yet, perhaps a monetary
        donation or a free copy of your product, we'll see).
  </ul>
  <p>
  Please be aware that the WinLDAP unit was created by Luk Vermeulen and can only
  be used and distributed under the MPL license. It's included because of dependencies
  on this unit. I may convert the header myself one day.

  <h2>Feedback</h2>

  Any and all feedback can be send to <a href="mailto:brakelm@chello.nl?subject=Win32Api">
  brakelm@chello.nl</a>. Please do not send me any generic API related questions,
  for that you should use the Borland newsgroups
  (see <a href="http://community.borland.com">the Borland Community site</a> for
  more information). Questions directly related to the use, or problems encountered
  by the use of, these units can of course be directed at the above address. Please
  include the phrase "Win32Api" in the subject header.

  <h2>Request an interface unit</h2>

  If you're in desperate need of an interface unit for some C/C++ API you can
  <a href="mailto:brakelm@chello.nl?subject=Win32Api Request">send me a request</a>
  through e-mail. I cannot promise that I will convert the unit(s) within any
  particular time frame, or at all, but I will let you know about it. Note that
  you can also hire me to do header conversions, in that case I will guarentee
  delivery within a certain time frame which depends on the header(s) themselves.
  Mail me at the above address for more information.
